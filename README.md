This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Tech Choices

The recruiter told me I was allowed to do it all in JavaScript tech. 
The requirements were for React, so an easy way to use TypeScript, React and a Node Backend is NextJS.  
Remix is knew on the scene and people like it, but I'm more familiar with Next.
NextJS comes baked in with CSS Modules, they do not offend me too much, so I decided to stick with if for this simple UX.

## Approach

I love a testing first apprach and TDD, and working top down from the end experience.
So lets start here.

## Running the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
